# Focus Reactive - Take Home assignment

We would like you to make an **isomorphic** application which displays weather information for some cities in the Netherlands.

Attached JSON file containing an array of weather information objects. The fields are as follows:

* `station_id` - The id of location
* `place_name` - The name of the location
* `latitude` - Latitude
* `longitude` - Longitude
* `datetime` - The date and time of this weather information temperature_max - Maximum temperature
* `temperature_min` - Minimum temperature
* `precipitation_probability` - The percentage probability of precipitation `precipitation_mm` - How much rain is expected for that day.

What we would like to see is a website which visualises the data in any way you see fit (graphs, maps, whatever).

There should be an option to filter the data by city, and also by date. What we would like to see:

* Use of React
* All source code used in the page (no dead, copied over code)
* Some level of test coverage (priorityze based on your own judgment)
* Optimzed build for production
* Something that makes us go ‘wow’
* Nice to have: use of TypeScript

The resulting code should be sent with a link to GitHub repo, and clear starting instructions. Bonus points for deployed version.
